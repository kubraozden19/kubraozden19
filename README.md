⚡ Fun fact: It's interesting that when you talk to computers, they are patient and understanding. However, after a certain point, when you realize that they start talking only with numbers, you may think that they actually understand the language of "code talk" better. I think sometimes we're told, "Come on human, write some code!" It is said. they want to say. 😄
